# Php.js
first things first i made this module for exersice on OOP and for joking 
How it Works:
just like any normal class in js all you have to do is download or copy the code and put it in a file and then bring it to your file as a module
codes:
well...in first day i mad two codes one is echo and second is print_r
1-echo: for printing srings,booleans,numbers and much more
example:
php.echo("Hello from Php.js");
2-print_r: for printing arrays and its syntax is write a variable in java script as a array then put elements in array in the recent version you can put up to 9 elements in the array
example:
  let array = ["hello", "hi", "bye"];
  php.print_r(array);
hope you enjoy the first version ðŸ˜„

Note: I am new to programming for other people(but i spent for a while in javascript(about 3 months)) and this is my first official attempt at OOP. If you find any error, tell me about it, and if you want any update, tell me
