# Php.js
How it Works:
well...in first day i mad two codes one is echo and second is print_r
1-echo: for printing srings,booleans,numbers and much more
example:
php.echo("Hello from Php.js")
2-print_r: for printing arrays and its syntax is write a variable in java script as a array and the first element in array index[0] put the name of the array(that's very important) then put elements in array in the recent version you can put up to 9 elements in the array


hope you enjoy the first version ðŸ˜„
